# awecontrib

One verify entry per repo, one version truth per repo. Use the `awecontrib` CLI directly; do not hand-write `verify` or CI files when the CLI can generate them.

Two things get installed through two different channels, and this skill is only one of them:

- **The CLI** (what you run): `pip install awecontrib` from PyPI. Until a release is on PyPI, install from the checkout: `pip install -e <path>` or call `<checkout>/.venv/bin/awecontrib`. Check with `awecontrib --version` before assuming it is available.
- **This skill** (what tells you when to run it): `aweskill install wehuman01/awecontrib`. Installing the skill does not install the CLI.

The invariant is **one entry point, and local runs exactly what CI runs**. The entry point's shape follows the stack: Python repos get an executable `./verify` file, Node repos get a `verify` script in package.json (`npm run verify` / `pnpm run verify`). Do not memorise one shape; look for whichever the repo has.

## Intent Router

| User intent | Command |
|---|---|
| "add verify / CI to this repo", "接入", "对齐" | `awecontrib install` (auto-detects Python/Node; `--python` / `--node` when both exist) |
| "run the checks", "提交前检查" | `./verify` (Python) · `npm run verify` / `pnpm run verify` (Node) |
| "bump to X", "升版本" | `awecontrib bump X [--note "..."]` |
| "junk in git", "egg-info tracked" | `awecontrib hygiene` (`--fix` prints the `git rm --cached` command, never runs it) |
| "release", "tag", "publish", "合并到 main" | **Not awecontrib** — hand off to `$peng-github-release-workflow` |

## Core Rules

1. **Inspect before mutating.** Work on a clean branch and read the existing `verify` / CI files first. `install` never overwrites them without `--force`, and `--force` is not yours to decide: it replaces whatever is there with the minimal template, which downgrades a repo that carries a matrix, a build step, or extra checks. Stop and ask the user before ever passing `--force`.
2. **verify must pass locally before you commit it.** If it is red, fix the repo, not the gate.
3. **CI runs only verify.** Any check worth running in CI belongs inside verify, so local and CI cannot drift. If a `release.yml` still runs its own test step (for example `unittest discover`), point it at verify.
4. **Series rule: tests must pass offline.** A gate that goes red on network hiccups gets ignored, which is worse than no gate. When verify is flaky, find the network call instead of raising timeouts. The reference case is aweskill: its `main()` pinged the npm registry as a side effect on every run, so every `main()`-based test hit the network and intermittently blew the 5s timeout; the fix was `AWESKILL_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1` in the vitest config, not a longer timeout. The tests were fine; a process side effect touched the network.
5. **One definition per check.** In Node repos prefer `npm run typecheck && npm run test` over inlining `tsc --noEmit && vitest run`, so changing a script changes verify too. Include `build` when the repo has a real build step (bundlers, DTS output).
6. **bump only edits files.** It changes the version carrier (pyproject `version`, `__version__`, or package.json) and prepends `## v<version>` to `docs/CHANGELOG.md`. No commit, no tag — the release flow owns git. Read the CHANGELOG first: some repos keep a standing `## Unreleased` heading that should be renamed, not duplicated.
7. **verify is the repo's file.** Editing it by hand is expected: add a matrix, a build step, a lint step. aweskill keeps its 3 OS × 2 Node matrix because its symlink/junction code is platform-specific; do not collapse it to the template.

## Onboarding a Repo

1. `cd <repo>` on a clean branch (`git status` empty).
2. `awecontrib install` — read what it printed.
3. Run verify locally until green.
4. `awecontrib hygiene` — clean.
5. Commit `verify` (or `package.json`) together with `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
6. Push; confirm the first CI run is green.
7. If `release.yml` exists, replace its test step with verify.

## Escalation

- verify red because of the repo's own tests or lint → fix the repo; that is the gate doing its job.
- verify red on a fresh checkout but green locally → look for a network or environment dependency in the tests.
- Release, tags, dev → main promotion → `$peng-github-release-workflow`.
- Skill install or projection problems → `$aweskill` / `$aweskill-doctor`.
